                    -->

                    <p style="font-size: 1em; margin-bottom: 26px; text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
                        Time is a strange concept. An intangible, metaphysical force that exists beyond the confines of this physical universe, transcending the 
                        boundaries of perception and understanding. It is a paradox, simultaneously fleeting and eternal, finite yet infinite <code>&#8212;</code> a 
                        mystery to be explored but at the same time, a truth to be embraced.
                    </p>

                    <p style="font-size: 1em; margin-bottom: 26px; text-align: justify;">
                        Time is more than just a measurement of moments passing; it is a cosmic force that governs the unfolding of events, the evolution of life, and 
                        the progression of consciousness. It is a constant companion, guiding us through this journey called life, marking the passage of days, months, 
                        and years with its steady rhythm.
                    </p>

                    <p style="font-size: 1em; margin-bottom: 26px; text-align: justify;">
                        Yet, despite its apparent consistency, time is also subjective <code>&#8212;</code> its passage influenced by our individual perceptions and 
                        experiences. A single moment can seem to stretch on indefinitely in times of boredom or monotony, while hours can slip by unnoticed in moments 
                        of joy or anticipation.
                    </p>

                    <p style="font-size: 1em; margin-bottom: 26px; text-align: justify;">
                        For a person who is about to surprise his loved ones, an 18 hour journey would feel mind-numbingly tedious. The 5-second pause before your 
                        girlfriend says yes to your proposal would feel like a million years. Conversely, the journey back home from office on a Friday night, and 
                        then back to work on a Monday morning, passes by in the blink of an eye.
                    </p>

                    <p style="font-size: 1em; margin-bottom: 26px; text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
                        Well, the 34 hour journey from Pondicherry to Kolkata fell in the latter category. The City of Joy was supposed to be 'just another pit stop' 
                        before embarking on the North-eastern leg of our adventure. Having never been to the Land of the Seven Sisters before, all of us were quite 
                        excited and spent the entire journey brainstorming additional activities to add to our planned itinerary.
                    </p>

                    <p style="font-size: 1em; margin-bottom: 26px; text-align: justify;">
                        As the train slowed down to pull into Howrah station, it was already dark outside. I reviewed our schedule for the next few days, mindful of 
                        the series of trains we needed to catch in the following 48 hours.
                    </p>

                    <p style="font-size: 1em; margin-bottom: 26px; text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
                        <ul style="list-style-type: square; margin: 42px;">
                            <li>Visit the Victoria Memorial in the morning</li>
                            <li>Walk around the city and have a wholesome meal. Subsequently leave for the station at 14:00.</li>
                            <li>Catch the Saraighat Express to Guwahati from Howrah at 16:05. Reach Guwahati at ~10:05 the next morning.</li>
                            <li>Wait at Guwahati station for ~11 hours till 21:20 to catch the Guwahati-Naharlagun InterCity Express.</li>
                            <li>Reach Naharlagun at 06:00 the morning after.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                    <p style="font-size: 1em; margin-bottom: 26px; text-align: justify;">
                        On paper, the plan was quite straightforward. If only, though, things went exactly as planned! Would we even be where we are today if that 
                        was the case?
                    </p>

                    <p style="font-size: 1em; margin-bottom: 26px; text-align: justify;">
                        Of course the plan went haywire! &#128514; In fact, you could say it got royally messed up! &#128514;
                    </p>

                    <p style="font-size: 1em; margin-bottom: 26px; text-align: justify;">
                        As soon as we got off the train, we rushed to our hotel to settle in for the night's rest. I'd fervently deny all claims that the long 
                        journey had been exacting, but the time at which we woke up the next morning would definitely reveal the truth.
                    </p>

                    <p style="font-size: 1em; margin-bottom: 26px; text-align: justify;">
                        Despite it being a late start, we decided to follow through with the original plan and went to the Victoria Memorial.
                    </p>

                    </div>

                    <p style="font-size: 1em; margin-bottom: 26px; text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
                        After just a brief visit, courtesy me annoyingly pointing at my watch, we moved on to check off the next item on the agenda. Walking along 
                        the streets offered us a glimpse into the rich history and culture of the city. The colonial-era architecture intersparsed with modern 
                        buildings, the tongas and the famous yellow taxis weaving their paths avoiding the trams; a true testament to the dynamic spirit of our 
                        country. The <span style="font-style: italic;">puchkas</span> in the carts and the <span style="font-style: italic;">Mishti Doi</span> we 
                        could see through the glass doors were quite tempting but the thought of an upset stomach while traveling was enough to dissuade us from 
                        feasting on them. We took a sensible approach, had a safe meal and then started to look for a taxi to take us back to Howrah station.
                    </p>

                    <p style="font-size: 1em; margin-bottom: 26px; text-align: justify;">
                        Now, this is where the royal mess up begins.
                    </p>

                    <p style="font-size: 1em; margin-bottom: 26px; text-align: justify;">
                        We searched and we searched but none of the taxis were willing to take us. The heavy rucksacks, as if pulling us down by our shoulders, were 
                        tiring us out. However, we continued to request the taxi wallahs, hoping that at least one of them would take pity and accept. But to no 
                        avail.
                    </p>

                    <p style="font-size: 1em; margin-bottom: 26px; text-align: justify;">
                        Mind you, we had not asked a yellow taxi yet, having been told that they usually quoted insanely high prices. The hour hand of the clock, 
                        though, pointing somewhere between the 3 and the 4 on the dial forced us to do that as well. And it went exactly as we expected. We disregarded  
                        his warning that finding a lower-priced option would be next to impossible. Instead, in a sense of defiance, we rejected his statement, trying 
                        to assert our authority over the situation.
                    </p>

                    <p style="font-size: 1em; margin-bottom: 26px; text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
                        We allowed some more of the precious minutes to pass by with absolutely zero success. We were definitely quite annoyed by the constant 
                        rejections, but what irked us even more was the sight of the yellow taxi wallah we had previously requested, still waiting nearby. He just 
                        stood there leaning against his vehicle, a smirk playing on his lips, as he saw us start getting panicky. He knew he had won.
                    </p>

                    <p style="font-size: 1em; margin-bottom: 26px; text-align: justify;">
                        Hell, even we knew he had won. But who in their right minds ever admits they were wrong? &#128514;
                    </p>

                    <p style="font-size: 1em; margin-bottom: 26px; text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
                        After a point, we did not have any more time to play these mind games. Conceding defeat, we went to the same yellow taxi guy and implored him 
                        to quickly drive us to the railway station, with the scheduled departure only 20 minutes away. Like a fresh graduate being rejected by all the 
                        companies wants to know where he can improve, we too wanted to know why we were being constantly rejected by anyone we asked for a ride.
                    </p>

                    <p style="font-size: 1em; margin-bottom: 26px; text-align: justify;">
                        His answer was something that just crushed our egos and brought us back to the ground from our imaginary clouds of 
                        <span style="font-style: italic;">sab APNE hisab se chalna chahiye</span> (Everything should happen the way WE wanted it to).
                    </p>

                    <p style="font-size: 1em; margin-bottom: 26px; text-align: justify;">
                        Apparently, we were on a one-way street, and to reach the railway station would entail covering a few redundant kilometers in fuel. A journey 
                        that should have been 15 minutes would require a further 10 minutes.
                    </p>

                    <p style="font-size: 1em; margin-bottom: 26px; text-align: justify;">
                        That was when the annoyance at the rejections, coupled with our own ignorance and carelessness, turned into an unsettling fear. We were already 
                        late, and the traffic was not helping our cause. Missing this train would derail our schedule completely, as the rest of the plan relied on us 
                        being aboard the Saraighat Express. We started hoping <code>&#8212;</code> nay, praying <code>&#8212;</code> that Indian Railways would stay 
                        true to their reputation.
                    </p>

                    <div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 70%;" class="polaroid">
                        <img src="yellow_taxi.png" alt="Me" style="width: 100%; margin-top: 0px; border-top-left-radius: 16px; border-top-right-radius: 16px;">
                        <div class="container">
                            <p style="font-style: italic;"></p>

                    </div>
                    
                    <p style="font-size: 1em; margin-bottom: 26px; text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
                        Full credit to the driver, though, as he skillfully navigated us through the maze of traffic, dropping us off at the entrance of the railway 
                        station precisely at 16:03. A quick glance at the information board to check the platform and we were off, running past coolies and vendors, 
                        pushing through the crowd to make sure not to miss the train.
                    </p>

                    <p style="font-size: 1em; margin-bottom: 26px; text-align: justify;">
                        The run, however, ended in despair. It was only 16:07 but the train had ditched us to be punctual, and we were left cursing 
                        our luck. Dejected, we slowly walked back out. On inquiring at the information center outside, we got to know that there was 
                        no other train going to Guwahati until the next day.
                    </p>

                    <p style="font-size: 1em; margin-bottom: 26px; text-align: justify;">
                        The silence was defeaning. We just looked at each other, panic clearly scribbled all over our faces. None of us said a word until Himanshu 
                        asked, <span style="font-style: italic;">Ab?</span>. Finally someone was being sensible. But the two of us weren't ready to be sensible yet. 
                        What followed was a barrage of complaints. About the city, the one-way traffic, the constant rejection of the taxi wallas, Indian Railways, 
                        every single entity involved. Well, except ourselves of course.
                    </p>

                    <p style="font-size: 1em; margin-bottom: 26px; text-align: justify;">
                        Once all the frustration had dissipated, we circled back to his question, realizing for once that mere complaining wouldn't really take us to 
                        our destination. We returned to the information center to inquire about any alternative routes that could ensure we wouldn't miss our train 
                        from Guwahati. The response ignited a small glimmer of hope within us.
                    </p>

                    <p style="font-size: 1em; margin-bottom: 26px; text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
                        Although there were none from Kolkata, trains ran frequently between New Jalpaiguri (NJP) and Guwahati. If we could somehow catch a bus that 
                        would reach NJP early the next morning, we could still make it to Guwahati by 21:00. Without wasting any more time, we hoisted our rucksacks 
                        and made our way to the nearest bus stop, where another dilemmatic situation awaited us.
                    </p>

                    <p style="font-size: 1em; margin-bottom: 26px; text-align: justify;">
                        There were quite a lot of buses going to NJP, both air conditioned as well as non-air conditioned. The AC buses were costing &#8377;3000 per 
                        seat while the non-AC buses were &#8377;1500 apiece. It was a non-brainer, but for a particular statement by one of the ticket vendor. 
                        Apparently, it was raining quite a lot along the way and the roads were partially flooded. The AC bus would have no problem passing through 
                        but it would be difficult for the non-AC buses if the flooding was substantial.

                        Now before you start calling us gullible idiots, remember that we were just 19, in a new city, had just missed an important train, and under a 
                        time crunch to reach Guwahati within the next 26 hours.
                    </p>

                    <p style="font-size: 1em; margin-bottom: 26px; text-align: justify;">
                        Eventually, the prevalent risk in getting stuck somewhere between Kolkata and NJP weighed heavily on our minds, prompting us to opt for the 
                        AC bus. As soon as the bus took off, we quickly got cozy in our recliner seats, relishing the comfort of the air conditioning 
                        <code>&#8212;</code> a luxury we knew we couldn't afford again, given the dent it had caused on our tight budget. We didn't bother to verify 
                        the accuracy of the information about the floods, nor did we check the details of the train we'd be catching from NJP. Those, in retrospect, 
                        seemed to be the least of our concerns at the time. All we cared about was getting some good sleep. &#128514;
                    </p>

                    <!--p style="font-size: 1em; margin-bottom: 26px; text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
                        As I look back on it now, what I find even more surprising is that we did not even bother to check which train to take from NJP to Guwahati. 
                        I cannot fathom not having done that, especially after the day we had had. We just slept off!

                        As soon as we got off the bus next morning, we took another bus to NJP station. We entered the platform and saw the Rajdhani Express waiting, 
                        as if finally Time was ticking in our favor. We obviously couldn't believe our luck, but did not want to celebrate too early too soon. It 
                        wasn't as if we could board the train just because it was right there. We quickly found the TTE and asked him if the train was empty enough to 
                        accommmodate 3 more people. Relieved, albeit partially, that we avoided another rejection, we settled into our allocated seats waiting to make 
                        it to Guwahati in time. We checked the schedule and found that, being the Rajdhani, it would stop only 3 more times before reaching Guwahati 
                        at 19:25. Enough time before our next train.
                    </p>

                    <p style="font-size: 1em; margin-bottom: 26px; text-align: justify;">
                        Or so we thought.
                    </p>

                    <p style="font-size: 1em; margin-bottom: 26px; text-align: justify;">
                        We spent the first couple of hours tending to our growling tummies, not paying any heed to what was going on outside the little world we had 
                        set up in the bogey that we had to ourselves. The air conditioning was quite tempting and we slept off again.
                    </p>

                    <p style="font-size: 1em; margin-bottom: 26px; text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
                        You know how the chugging of the train induces a gentle rhythmic rocking in anyone and everyone travelling on it? It was precisely the lack of 
                        that feeling for a prolonged time that made us suspicious. We opened the curtains and saw that, as predicted, the train had come to a stop. In 
                        the middle of nowhere. Unexpected, but not surprising.
                    </p>

                    <p style="font-size: 1em; margin-bottom: 26px; text-align: justify;">
                        We checked Google Maps and confirmed that the train was already about an hour late and counting. Now this was a cause of concern. We had a 
                        mere margin of 2 hours, half of which had already been eaten away. We asked people from adjacent bogeys but they too were clueless like us. 
                        Although unlike us, they weren't bothered. After all, they weren't the ones on a makeshift schedule because of a missed train.
                    </p>

                    <p style="font-size: 1em; margin-bottom: 26px; text-align: justify;">
                        Panic had begun to settle in and there was pin drop silence. The watches on the wrists were getting more glances than the books in our hands. 
                        The feet constantly tapping the train's belly, urging some kind of a response. The train, however, seemed to be in a deep slumber, nonchalant 
                        to its inner turmoils. The minutes flew by, but nothing seemed to happen.
                    </p>

                    <p style="font-size: 1em; margin-bottom: 26px; text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
                        All of a sudden, we heard the prolonged blaring of the horn and the train started moving. This did not seem to calm our nerves down though. 
                        Even if the train did stay consistent from then onwards, we were sure to be late for the train from Guwahati. Our entire plan seemed to 
                        collapse, leaving us once again bereft of alternatives. We were forced to entertain the possibility of having to stay in Guwahati for the night 
                        and look at other options.
                    </p>

                    <p style="font-size: 1em; margin-bottom: 26px; text-align: justify;">
                        Just then, the TC walked in, informing us of the reason for the delay. However, we paid no attention, immediately launching into the narrative 
                        of our predicament. He patiently listened to the adventure we'd had and sympathized with our situation, assuring us that he will inform us any 
                        possible options. We saw him checking something in his notebook, conversing with someone on the phone and then writing something down. When he 
                        came back, true to his word, he gave us just one solution along with a disclaimer.
                    </p>

                    

                    <p style="font-size: 1em; margin-bottom: 26px; text-align: justify;">
                        The Rajdhani Express approaching Guwahati would pass a station called Rangiya Junction along the way. Since the train was running late, it 
                        would most certainly make another unscheduled stop there. The train we were supposed to catch from Guwahati was also scheduled to make a stop 
                        at Rangiya Junction. If the Time Gods were looking down on us favorably, the train we were on would reach Rangiya Junction just in time for us 
                        to catch the next train. If not, we would have to spend the night in Guwahati. That remained the only option. There was no other place where 
                        the paths of the two trains intersected.

                        There was a new hope now. A real chance to get our plans back on track. We packed our bags in advance and waited in anticipation for the TC to 
                        come and let us know when we were about to arrive. On this occasion, time couldn't have flown by any faster. It was as if just a moment ago we 
                        were waiting on the TC for any alternatives and now he was back to inform us that we'd be reaching Rangiya in about 10 minutes. He also told us 
                        that the Guwahati-Naharlagun IC express was on schedule and would also be reaching Rangiya in 10 minutes, arriving from the other side.
                    </p>

                    <p style="font-size: 1em; margin-bottom: 26px; text-align: justify;">
                        We picked up our bags, tightened the straps and walked up to the door of the train car. Everything had been stuffed inside, nothing left to 
                        hold in our hands, just in case we were required to run again. We couldn't miss this chance. We were not prepared to spend the night on the 
                        platform in such a remote location.
                    </p>

                    <p style="font-size: 1em; margin-bottom: 26px; text-align: justify;">
                        The platform floor glided into view under our feet and the train started decelerating. We stood at the edge of the entrance, holding on till 
                        the train came to a commplete halt, like boiling milk just on the verge of spilling over. As if almost on cue, our next ride arrived at the 
                        same time from the opposite side on the adjacent platform. This time we really couldn't believe our luck. We looked back at the TC, thanked 
                        him for all the help, spilled over onto the still moving platform and ran across. Without wasting any time, we boarded the new train, 
                        jubiliant at the change in our fortunes. Settling into our seats, we snuggled up with our backpacks and drifted off to sleep.

                        As I reflect on it after all these years, I 
                        can definitely say that those were one of the most happening 48 hours of my life. I may not have realized it at that time, but the way we 
                        overcame every challenge without dwelling too much on the negatives is something all of us, including me, should carry forward.

                        People often say it's not just about reaching the destination, but the experiences along the way that truly matter. Some argue that the 
                        companionship during the journey matters even more. Without the company, though, would the journey even feel complete? I certainly don't think 
                        so. Reflecting on those 48 hours after all these years, I really cannot imagine the outcome if I did not have my friends by my side. Their 
                        presence was pivotal in maintaining my sanity in the direst of circumstances and, surprisingly, making the experience enjoyable as well.

                        I have been fortunate enough to have had such brilliant company throughout this short, but what feels like a long, journey. If you are still 
                        reading my ramblings, you're undoubtedly one of those cherished companions. And for that, I'm incredibly grateful!
