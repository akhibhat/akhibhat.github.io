        It was somewhere in the mid of February 2016, when the mail was floated. There was a whirl of excitement among the second years and the first years as it is 
        the most sought after fellowship here at IIT Gandhinagar for freshmen and sophomores. Everyone I met, was either busy making their group or listing out the 
        places they would like to visit during the fellowship.

        Let me take a moment to tell you about the 'fellowship' that I'm talking about so that you get why even the thought was so exciting. 
        So the Explorers Fellowship is a fellowship offered by our college, IIT Gandhinagar, to its students where the students have to go around travelling India 
        for a period of 42 days. Oh, only if it was so easy! You need to travel 6 states, one each from the north, north-east and the south in a budget of 
        just Rs.35000. No, that's not all! All the travelling you do must be either in state transport or by sleeper class railway. The main aim of this fellowship 
        is for us, students, to understand how people in different parts of our country live. Most of us come from middle class or upper class families and 
        hence do not understand the difficulties which other people face. This fellowship gives you a peek at the stark reality and helps you realize that you 
        are so lucky!

        Even though travelling 42 days without the comfort of a IIIAC compartment or the stylish Volvo buses was a bit unsettling, 
        the idea of getting to travel around India that too with some of your closest friends was thrilling. I knew I had to take this opportunity, 
        but would Mom let me go? I left this question unanswered and thought I would ask if I got selected for it.

        Step I : Forming a group with whom you would be comfortable. Well, I already had one member in my group. The other two joined somehow, something which none 
        of us remember exactly! But here we were, the four of us - me, Himanshu (my roommate), Mohit and Zainab - ready to make a commitment to travel together for 
        42 days, no matter what differences crept in. The next few days went in planning the 42 days of summer. The locations, the modes of commutation, the expenses 
        etc. etc. etc. We had a complete plan ready by the day of the interview. Although the interview did not go well, we were selected!!!! We had been given an 
        opportunity to go and explore different parts of India.

        Now came the most important part - to tell Mom. I was unsure if Mom would let me go for the trip that too with a girl and I desperately wanted to 
        go. I had a feeling that she would reject even the idea of wasting my summer travelling, instead of doing some internship. So I thought I'd tell her later 
        (which did not come very soon)
    </p>

    <p>
        The semester ended soon and we had a concrete plan ready but I had still not told my parents about it ðŸ˜›. I realized that it was time I told or I might 
        have to lie about continuing my internship for the entire summer. I called my Mom one fine day, checked if her mood was okay and then just went with the flow. 
        Surprisingly, she said yes but only after asking hundreds of questions. Mohit dropped out due to academic reasons and it was just us three, 
        <strong>The Wayfarer Troop!</strong>

    <p>
        A week before we were due to leave, we had all our bags packed, itinerary prepared, trains, buses, hostels and hotels booked, a plan ready for everyday in 
        each of the places we were to visit. Little did we know of the unexpected, thrilling and draining events that lay ahead of us!
    </p>

    <p>
        Unlike the other teams, we started our journey in mid-June, by the time the monsoons had engulfed almost three-fourths of India. We wouldn't say that it 
        was a consciously taken decision, but somehow (as you will read in the further posts) it turned out to be one of the best decisions of the trip!
