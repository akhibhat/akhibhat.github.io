    <h1>Pattern recognition: Human behavior -> AI... -> astrology?</h1>

    Individuals like you and me, who have walked the Earth for quite some time, have a fair understanding of how the world works and how we need to act in a variety 
    of situations.

    While waiting to cross an intersection under normal circumstances, it wouldn't surprise us if a car zoomed past just as the light turned yellow. On the other hand, 
    the traffic light pole suddenly disappearing, buildings turning inside out, or people's faces morphing into mythical creatures? Must be a dream or a Marvel movie.

    After rigorous lessons and having driven hundreds of kilometers, it becomes second nature to take your foot off the accelerator and step on the brakes when 
    you approach a red light. You subconsciously put on the indicators before you take a turn because, well, those are the rules that you learned. Some of you probably 
    won't even require Google Maps to drive to places that you have already visited before. Your mind knows exactly which flyover to take and which lane to exit from.

    (However, all this understanding of the world around us is precisely because of the length of time we have spent observing it while doing things over and over again.)
    
    But picture this.

    You're a kid, maybe of one or two. Crawling on all fours, you reach the kitchen where your parents are scurrying around trying to prepare an elaborate 
    meal for their friends who are about to arrive. Seeing you, mum lifts you up and props you on the kitchen platform so that you don't 
    get hurt in all the commotion. You smell something wonderful nearby, look around and locate the likely source. What do you do?

    You touch it. 
    
    But the sensation that hits has you confused. You expected it to make you smile, but your tiny hand has turned all red. You turn to look at your mum and 
    start bawling as the pain starts to seep in. Even though you don't really comprehend what just happened, one thing did get clearly ingrained in your brain. 
    
    NEVER touch anything on the kitchen platform even if it smells like heaven.

    I'm sure a lot of you must have had such an experience in your childhood. I'm also sure that never again did you intentionally touch something 
    on the stove with your bare hands.

    How did this happen? How did you go from a baby who touched the hot utensil to knowing the exact moment to step on the brakes to make your vehicle come to a stop 
    just in time?

    Through brain imaging studies neuroscientists have shown that, on a molecular and cellular level, the human brain is remarkably similar to that of non-human 
    primates and lower mammals. It retains many features of brain structure and cellular organization of the brains of birds. Neuroanatomical and neurochemical 
    considerations suggest that the superior intellectual capabilities of humans are largely the result of the increase in the number of neurons and synapses. For 
    example, mice have 1 billion neurons in their nervous system as compared to humans that have approximately 30 billion only in the brain. It is this huge contrast 
    in numbers and the integrated function of these pattern-processing networks that makes us mentally superior beings.

    (that allows enhanced encoding, integration and inter-individual transfer of patterns.)

    Basically what this means is that it is not the molecular or cellular structure of our brains that makes us different. It is instead, more of a numerical advantage.
    As the sheer number of neurons present and the connections between them increases, we become better at encoding humongous amounts of detailed patterns, 
    integrating all of this information, and making appropriate decisions in pertinent situations.

    This is exactly what happens as we age. Even though a newborn baby has all of the neurons they'll have for the rest of their lives, it is through the various 
    experiences that help develop the connections between these neurons.

    (For a lot of us, the personalities that we build up in life are a consequence of the actions that we took and the lessons that we learned from them.)

    Some of you may already know that techniques used to teach robots to be more like humans are somewhat based on these principles.

    For those of you who are not familiar, bear with me as I try to give you a taste of this vast field of artificial intelligence or AI.

    - Face unlock in phones
    - Facebook automatically suggesting names of people to tag in your photos

    - Recommender systems on Netflix, Amazon etc.
    - Reinforcement learning (use the Boston Dynamics robot video)

    In robotics you plan a path considering the environmental conditions a few seconds before and also a few seconds after.

    <p>
        Now hold on to this thought as we move to the final piece of this blog. And don't worry, it will all make some sense at least ;P
    </p>

    <p>
        It has already been established that the 10 celestial bodies - Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto - and the 12 
        constellations - Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, and Pisces - do exist and the data about their 
        positions in the sky is available.
    </p>

    <p>

        Now if we observe from the Earth's perspective, the skies can be perceived as a hollow sphere with all the celestial entities projected on to it. We call 
        this huge globe encompassing the entire Earth, the Celestial Sphere. 
    </p>

    <p>

        We also know that the Earth spins around its axis which is tilted at an angle 23 deg 47' to the vertical from the West to the East. As a result of this, 
        from the Earth's frame of reference, any point on the Celestial Sphere can be seen to rise from the East and set in the West.
    </p>

    <p>
        The apparent annual path of the Sun as projected on the Celestial Sphere is called as the Ecliptic. If you observe the path of the other celestial bodies, 
        you will notice that they also move in their individual orbits slightly inclined to the Ecliptic. The interesting thing to note here is that no planet 
        crosses more than 7.5 degrees north or south of the Ecliptic. This belt of 15 degrees has been called the Zodiac. It is also worth noting that the 
        Zodiac gets divided into 12 parts by the previously mentioned 12 constellations that lie in and about this Zodiac belt. This further makes it easier to 
        record the position of the celestial bodies at each time with respect to the constellations.
    </p>

    <p>
        Before we finally connect everything together we need to locate 2 imaginary, but very important, points in the sky. The Moon's orbit around the Earth as 
        projected on the Celestial Sphere intersects the Ecliptic at 2 distinct points in the sky. These are known as the North node and South node, widely 
        popular to us as Rahu and Ketu respectively.
    </p>

    <p>
        Say you take a screenshot of the sky at the exact moment and at the precise location that some major event takes place in the world. And then you compare 
        these screenshots to search for patterns in them.
    </p>

    <p>
        Do you get what I'm hinting towards with this?
    </p>

    <p>
        What I am trying to say is if you look at astrology as mere patterns that we detect in the screenshots taken, it all makes sense, doesn't it?
    </p>

    <p>
        The celestial bodies are in continuous motion on their respective orbits at their respective speeds. After a definitive amount of time, the celestial 
        bodies return to the position that they were once at. Astrologers basically study these motions and help determine how each pattern affects the world as 
        a whole and how the lives of individuals are influenced.
    </p>

    <p>
        Let us keep the discussion about influence on humans for another day and focus only on how these patterns affect the world.
    </p>

    Nature uses only the longest threads to weave her patterns, so that each small piece of her fabric reveals the organization of the entire tapestry.
